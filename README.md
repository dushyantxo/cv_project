Overview of dijsktra's shortest path finding visualiser

A simple visual representation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using SFML. The project allows users to interact with a grid, place obstacles, and visualize the shortest path between two points.
Features

  Left-click to place obstacles.
  Right-click to set start and end points.
  Visualizes the shortest path in real-time.
  Reset the grid to start over.

Requirements

  SFML library.
  C++11 or higher.
